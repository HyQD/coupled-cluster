# Time-dependent coupled cluster

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/Schoyen/coupled-cluster.svg?token=MvgH7xLNL8iVfczJpp8Q&branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/Schoyen/coupled-cluster)

This repository provides coupled cluster solvers for single reference many-body quantum mechanical problems. An emphasize has been put on time-dependent systems, but as a consequence we also provide coupled cluster solvers for groundstate computations.

## Installation
This project can be installed by running:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/Schoyen/coupled-cluster.git
```
