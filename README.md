This repository provides coupled cluster solvers for single reference many-body quantum mechanical problems. An emphasis has been put on time-dependent systems, but as a consequence we also provide coupled cluster solvers for groundstate computations. See the [documentation](https://hyqd.github.io/coupled-cluster/).
